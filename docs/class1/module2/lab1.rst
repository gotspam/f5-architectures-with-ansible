Prompting for user input
========================

You will create a playbook to prompt the user to provide credentials.  Use
the ``vars_prompt`` in your Playbook.

**Run a BIG-IP tmsh command.**

#. Create a playbook ``cmd.yaml``.

   - Type ``nano playbooks/cmd.yaml``
   - Type the following into the ``playbooks/cmd.yaml`` file.


   .. code::

    ---

    - name: "Run a tmsh command"
      hosts: bigips
      gather_facts: False
      connection: local

      vars:
        validate_certs: no
        server: 10.1.1.245

      vars_prompt:
        - name: "username"
          prompt: "Enter BIG-IP username"
          private: yes
        - name: "password"
          prompt: "Enter BIG-IP password"
          private: yes

      tasks:
        - name: View system version and LTM configuration
          bigip_command:
            commands:
              - list /ltm virtual all
              - list /ltm pool all
              - list /ltm node all
            server: "{{ server }}"
            password: "{{ password }}"
            user: "{{ username }}"
            validate_certs: "{{ validate_certs }}"
          register: result

        - debug: msg="{{ result.stdout_lines }}"

#. Run this playbook.

   - Type ``ansible-playbook playbooks/cmd.yaml``

   You will be prompted to enter username and password before executing the
   playbook.  If successful, you should see config for virtual servers, pools and nodes.


   .. NOTE::

     Prompting is a great way to get input from the user. It can function in both
     an interactive, and non-interactive way.

     The ``bigip_command`` module is what we recommend for all situations where you
     need to do something that a current module does not support.

     This module will **always** warn you when you use it for things that change
     configuration. These warnings will inform you to file an issue on our Github
     Issue tracker for a feature enhancement.

     Ultimately, the goal we want to get to is to have a suite of modules that
     meets all the needs of customers that use Ansible. Since that is not yet possible,
     the ``bigip_command`` is there to accommodate.

     This module can also be used over SSH, but password SSH is the only method known
     to work at this time.
