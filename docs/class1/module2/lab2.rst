Securing and passing credentials
================================

You need to store passwords for use in Ansible.  Use ``ansible-vault``.
The `ansible-vault` command has three subcommands that are frequently used.

* create
* edit

**Create vault for credentials**

#. Create a vault ``creds.yaml``.

   - Type ``ansible-vault create creds.yaml``

   Use ``create`` to create the initial files that will be vault encrypted.
   Vault will prompt you for a password. For the purposes of this lab enter
   ``password`` . It will then open up a text editor (vi)
   for you to write data to it. Data of any form can be written, but text is
   usually the format that is used.

   - Type ``i`` then enter the following in the editor.

   .. code::

     bigip_user: "admin"
     bigip_pass: "admin"


   Type ``esc key`` then ``wq!`` to save and quit the editor, the file will
   automatically be encrypted for you.

   - Type ``cat creds.yaml`` to ensure file is encrypted.

   If successful, you should see similar results

#. Copy ``playbooks/cmd.yaml`` to ``playbooks/cmd1.yaml`` and modify.

   - Type ``cp playbooks/cmd.yaml playbooks/cmd1.yaml``
   - Type ``nano playbooks/cmd1.yaml``

   .. code::

     ---

     - name: "Run a tmsh command"
       hosts: bigips
       gather_facts: False
       connection: local

       vars:
         validate_certs: no
         server: 10.1.1.245
         username: "{{ bigip_user }}"
         password: "{{ bigip_pass }}"

       tasks:
         - name: View system version and LTM configuration
           bigip_command:
             commands:
               - list /ltm virtual all
               - list /ltm pool all
               - list /ltm node all
             server: "{{ server }}"
             password: "{{ password }}"
             user: "{{ username }}"
             validate_certs: "{{ validate_certs }}"
           register: result

         - debug: msg="{{ result.stdout_lines }}"


#. Run this playbook.

   - Type ``ansible-playbook playbooks/cmd1.yaml -e @creds.yaml --ask-vault-pass``


   You will be prompted for vault password before executing the playbook.
   If successful, you should see config for virtual servers, pools and nodes.

.. NOTE::

  Use ``ansible-vault edit creds.yaml`` to modify the vault.  You will be prompted
  for vault password before editor opens vault file.
